#### ‚ö†Ô∏èRules :grey_exclamation: :grey_exclamation: :smirk_cat: :smirk_cat: :smirk_cat::

‚úÖ Pull requests can be submitted to any opted-in repository on GitHub or GitLab.

‚úÖ The pull request must contain commits you made yourself.

‚úÖ If a maintainer reports your pull request as 'spam' or 'invalid', it will not be counted toward your participation in Hacktoberfest.

‚úÖ If a maintainer reports behaviour that‚Äôs not in line with the project‚Äôs code of conduct, you will be ineligible to participate.

‚úÖ To get a shirt, you must make four approved pull requests (PRs) on opted-in projects between October 1-31 in any time zone.
This year, the first 55,000 participants can earn a T-shirt.

#### ‚ö†Ô∏èWhat not to do :exclamation: :exclamation: :triumph: :triumph:

‚ùå PRs that are automated (e.g. scripted opening PRs to remove whitespace/optimize images)

‚ùå PRs that are disruptive (e.g. taking someone else‚Äôs branch/commits and making a PR)

‚ùå PRs that are regarded by a project maintainer as a hindrance vs. helping

‚ùå Something that‚Äôs clearly an attempt to simply +1 your PR count for October
